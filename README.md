When choosing a library, it’s important to consider factors such as the specific requirements of your trading strategy, the ease of use, and the community support behind the library. Each of these libraries has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it’s worth exploring them to find the best fit for your needs.

The most honest approach to developing trading models is to create your own tool that addresses real issues such as liquidity, costs, and distribution. Many quantitative models fail because their creators misinterpret the results and fall victim to confirmation bias. Often, they rely on out-of-sample data that yields impressive returns and high r-squared values, leading them to invest based on flawed assumptions.

To ensure proper back-testing and avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence, it’s essential to develop your own tool. This approach fosters honesty in the development process and helps mitigate the “God complex” that many quants struggle with. By crafting a tool tailored to your specific needs, you can accurately assess the performance and viability of your trading strategies.
